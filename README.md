# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The ultimate goal of churn analysis is to reduce churn and increase profits. As more customers stay longer, revenue should increase, and profits should follow.
The main objective of this model is to predict if a customer is going to churn in order to:

  -Improve the customer experience
  
  -Optimize the banks products and services
  
  -Customer retention (opposite of churn)

Focusing on maximize the recall score which in our case maximize the True Positives (How many customers did really churn) and minimizing the False Negatives (How many customers we predicted they wouldn't churn but they did)
